Numbers
=======

This project solves the following seemingly simple task:

> Find all combinations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which evaluates into 100.

> You can insert operators +, *, - and _concat_ between numbers.

> Order of numbers is not important, but each number shold appear once and only
> once.

> 1 _concat_ 2 = 12.

Resource usage
--------------

On my hardware (4-core Intel Core i7 870@2.93 GHz with HyperThreading enabled)
the program executes for about 4.5 hours. It uses only small amount of RAM
(about 15 MiB).
